# SG code

## Project description
This project is able to take parameters in order to collect information from a table in the database.
Furthermore it's possible to create a new table and insert information into the table.
There are two get commands, one will get an interval of date and times from the chosen table as chosen by the user. The other one will simply collect the top values from the database, limited by user input but with a default input of 10.

## Technologies used
This project uses FastAPI to create a quick API Framework in order to query the database that was created using psycopg2 and is also what connects the python project with the PostgreSQL database.

## Challenges
This project has been put into a docker container which was quite a challenge to do to ensure that both the database and server were put into the same controller and working together. Since it was also the first time using Docker it was quite a challenge to get it all going like intended.

## Future improvements
The code could do with a lot of improvements that have not been implemented because of a lack of time. The code is note as modulated and as it could be and improvements could be made for how methods are made. More classes could have been used and better handling to make the code have an overall higher quality.

One of the requirements of the challenge was scalability but this was not something that I had time to implement in the given time frame. Given enough time I would have liked to work on this more in order to really create an application that could easily scale up and down.

## How to run the project
1. Clone repository
2. Run docker compose up --build
3. Go to localhost:8000/docs
4. Create table
5. Insert data into table that you just created (will take a long time)
6. Query data

### Query parameters for testing api_queries get_data
In order to get data
- ```table_name``` = the name that you chose in step 4 (string)
- ```start_time``` = YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS (string)
- ```end_time``` = YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS (string)
- ```interval_minutes``` = integer
