# 2. Fastapi as framework

Date: 2023-07-23

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The choice to use FastAPI was made based on reading about what API Frameworks to use when dealing with time series. It also had good reviews and said it would speed up work.

## Decision

Because I read that FastAPI was both fast and mitigated errors during development I chose to use it.

## Consequences

Creating and using the API Framework was fairly easy and time wasn't wasted having to debug since it worked from the start.
